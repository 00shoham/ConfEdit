* Get and build idanlib (https://github.com/00shoham/idanlib).

* Get, build and install/configure auth2cookie (https://github.com/00shoham/auth2cookie).

* Make a working directory, such as:

  mkdir /var/confedit

* Make that working directory editable by the user in whose security context
  the web server (e.g., Apache2) runs:

  chown -R www-data /var/confedit
  chmod -R 755 `find /var/confedit -type d`

* Make a configuration file that tells confedit about the dialect of
  configuration files it should be editing.  Put that in
  /usr/local/etc/confedit.ini.

  This config file must share an encryption key
  (/usr/local/etc/key.ini) with auth2cookie.

* Install the confedit CGI program and UI:

  cd confedit/src
  ./install-web.sh

* Visit the UI at https://(your-hostname)/confedit/ui.html
