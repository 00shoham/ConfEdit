ConfEdit is a simple web UI for editing .ini style configuration files,
which are text files such that each line may be one of:

  VARIABLE_NAME=value
or
  (blank)
or
  #comment
or
  #include "another-filename"

Values may be strings, or references to other variables, or booleans, or
numbers, or dates.

VARIABLE_NAMES are either pre-defined in the dialect of the configuration
file, or used for subsequent expansion, in $VARIABLE_NAME fashion inside
the value of another variable.

Projects such as RevSim (https://github.com/00shoham/revsim) use this
style of configuration file to setup their behaviour.

Configuration files are obviously editable in a text editor (Notepad,
pico, nano, vim, emacs, whatever), but some people prefer a more "friendly"
web UI, especially one that understands the syntax of the file, and so
ConfEdit was born.
